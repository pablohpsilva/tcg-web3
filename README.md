  - **CardSet.sol**: Main game contract with military-grade protections
  - **130 comprehensive tests** covering all security scenarios

### Packages

- `packages/*`: Shared packages (coming soon)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) for smart contract development

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development Commands

#### Build

Build all apps and packages:

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Test (with Security Validation)

Run tests across all packages including comprehensive security tests:

```bash
npm run test
# ✅ All 130 tests should pass including security validations
```

#### Development

Start development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Linting

Run linting across all packages:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Smart Contract Development with Security

The smart contracts are located in `apps/contracts/`. You can work with them using these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to contracts
cd apps/contracts

# Build contracts with optimization
npm run build
# or: forge build --optimize

# Run comprehensive security tests
npm run test
# or: forge test -vvv

# Run specific security test suites
forge test --match-contract "Security" -vvv
forge test --match-test "testEmergencyPause" -vvv

# Security analysis
forge test --gas-report
slither . --exclude-dependencies

# Deploy with security features (example)
npm run deploy
# or: forge script script/DeployCardSet.s.sol --broadcast --verify
```

## 🛠️ Adding New Apps

To add a new app to the monorepo:

1. Create a new directory in `apps/`
2. Add a `package.json` with appropriate scripts
3. **Include security considerations** in your app design
4. Add comprehensive tests including security scenarios
5. Update the root workspace configuration if needed
6. The Turborepo will automatically detect and include it

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

When developing with this codebase:

1. **Always run security tests** before any deployment
2. **Use multisig wallets** for production ownership
3. **Monitor security events** in real-time
4. **Test emergency procedures** regularly
5. **Validate all user inputs** comprehensively
6. **Follow the principle of least privilege**

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

If you detect a security issue:

1. **Activate emergency pause** immediately
2. **Assess the threat scope** and impact
3. **Apply targeted mitigations** using security locks
4. **Document the incident** for post-analysis
5. **Communicate with stakeholders** transparently

```bash
# Emergency pause activation
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "emergencyPause()" --private-key <EMERGENCY_KEY>

# Check security status
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "getSecurityStatus()"
```
