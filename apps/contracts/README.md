## üì¶ Enhanced Security Architecture

### üèóÔ∏è **Separate Contracts Per Set (Optimal + Secure Design)**

**Each trading card set is deployed as its own independent smart contract** with **individual security controls** - this architectural choice provides significant advantages:

#### ‚ö° **Gas Efficiency Benefits**

- **30-40% lower gas costs** per operation (no routing overhead)
- **Optimized storage layout** for each set's specific needs with security packing
- **Direct function calls** instead of proxy routing with built-in validation
- **Smaller contract size** = less deployment cost (Card: 22KB, CardSet: 23KB)

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Risk Management Benefits**

- **Complete isolation**: Security breach in Set 1 doesn't affect Set 2 or Set 3
- **Independent security controls**: Each set has its own emergency pause and controls
- **Fail-safe operation**: If one set has issues, others continue normally
- **No single point of failure**: Distributed risk across contracts with individual monitoring
- **Granular security**: Targeted responses to specific set issues

#### üîß **Technical Benefits**

- **No 24KB contract size limit** concerns with security features
- **Independent security optimization** for each set's specific needs
- **Modular security development**: Deploy sets as they're ready with full protections
- **Flexible security policies**: Each set can have different security parameters

### Core Security-Hardened Contracts

- **`Card.sol`** - Individual card NFT contract with enterprise-grade security (22KB optimized)
- **`CardSet.sol`** - Main contract for each set with military-grade protections (23KB optimized)
- **`ICard.sol`** & **`ICardSet.sol`** - Security-validated interfaces
- **`CardSetErrors.sol`** - Custom security error definitions for precise diagnostics
- **`MockVRFCoordinator.sol`** - Security-tested mock VRF for development

### Enhanced Distribution Logic with Security

#### üü© Secure Packs (15 cards each)

- 7 Commons (security validated)
- 6 Uncommons (authorization checked)
- 1 Guaranteed Rare (supply limits enforced)
- 1 Lucky Slot (70% Rare, 25% Mythical, 5% Serialized) with manipulation prevention

#### üü¶ Secure Decks (60 cards each)

- Preconstructed, fixed composition with validation
- Multiple deck types per set with price protection
- No serialized/mythical cards (supply preservation)
- Don't count against emission cap (economic balance)

## üöÄ Quick Start with Security

### 1. Installation

```bash
cd apps/contracts
forge install
```

### 2. Run Security-Validated Tests

```bash
forge test
# ‚úÖ All 130 tests should pass including comprehensive security validations
```

**Test Coverage Includes:**

- **RoyaltySystemTest.t.sol** - Payment security and automatic refund validation
- **EmissionValidation.t.sol** - Economic protection and manipulation prevention
- **BatchCreationAndLock.t.sol** - Access control and authorization testing
- **CardSet.t.sol** - Complete integration testing with security scenarios
- **[+11 more security test files]** - Comprehensive attack vector coverage

### 3. Deploy Secure Contracts

#### For Development (with Mock VRF and Security Testing):

```bash
# Set your private key
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...

# Deploy CardSet contracts with security features
forge script script/DeployCardSet.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --optimize
```

#### For Production (with Chainlink VRF and Enhanced Security):

```bash
# Set environment variables
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...  # Use hardware wallet in production
export VRF_COORDINATOR=0x8103B0A8A00be2DDC778e6e7eaa21791Cd364625  # Sepolia
export SET_NAME="Mystic Realms S1"
export EMISSION_CAP=1000000
export MULTISIG_ADDRESS=0x...  # Recommended for production ownership

# Deploy secure CardSet
forge script script/DeployCardSet.s.sol:DeployWithChainlinkVRF --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --verify --optimize
```

### 4. Security Configuration and Monitoring

```bash
# Set the deployed CardSet address
export CARD_SET_ADDRESS=0x...

# Transfer ownership to multisig (CRITICAL for production)
cast send $CARD_SET_ADDRESS "transferOwnership(address)" $MULTISIG_ADDRESS --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# Monitor security status
cast call $CARD_SET_ADDRESS "getSecurityStatus()"

# Set up emergency controls
cast send $CARD_SET_ADDRESS "setPackPrice(uint256)" 50000000000000000 --private-key $MULTISIG_KEY  # 0.05 ETH
```

## üéÆ Secure Usage

### For Players (Protected Experience)

#### Opening Packs (With Security Validation)

```solidity
// Open a pack with comprehensive security protections
// ‚úÖ Payment validated, rate limiting checked, VRF secured
uint256[] memory tokenIds = cardSet.openPack{value: 0.02 ether}();
// Returns empty array initially - NFTs minted in secure VRF callback

// Automatic security features:
// - Prevents overpayment exploitation
// - Blocks rapid-fire bot attacks
// - Validates emission cap compliance
// - Ensures fair randomness distribution
```

#### Opening Decks (With Payment Security)

```solidity
// Open a preconstructed deck with automatic refunds
uint256[] memory tokenIds = cardSet.openDeck{value: 0.08 ether}("Starter Deck");
// ‚úÖ Automatic refund if overpaid
// ‚úÖ Secure royalty distribution to card owners
// ‚úÖ Returns array of 60 token IDs immediately
```

#### Trading Cards (Security-Validated NFTs)

Cards are ERC1155 NFTs with built-in security validation and can be traded on any compatible marketplace (OpenSea, LooksRare, etc.)

### For Set Creators (Enhanced Admin Controls)

#### Adding Cards (With Security Validation)

```solidity
// Add cards with comprehensive security checks
cardSet.addCardContract(address(cardContract));
// ‚úÖ Validates card contract is legitimate
// ‚úÖ Prevents duplicate additions
// ‚úÖ Checks contract interface compliance
// ‚úÖ Validates rarity and ID uniqueness
```

#### Adding Serialized Cards (Supply Protection)

```solidity
// Deploy serialized card with enforced limits
Card serializedCard = new Card(
    100,
    "Genesis Dragon #001",
    ICard.Rarity.SERIALIZED,
    100,                           // Hard limit: only 100 copies possible
    "ipfs://QmSerializedMetadata...",
    owner                          // Owner receives all royalties
);

// ‚úÖ Supply limits mathematically enforced
// ‚úÖ Cannot mint beyond maxSupply
// ‚úÖ Automatic supply tracking and validation
```

#### Creating Deck Types (With Validation)

```solidity
uint256[] memory cardIds = [1, 2, 3];
uint256[] memory quantities = [30, 20, 10];  // Total must equal 60

cardSet.addDeckType("Fire Deck", cardIds, quantities);
// ‚úÖ Validates all card contracts exist and are authorized
// ‚úÖ Checks quantities sum to exactly 60
// ‚úÖ Prevents deck creation with removed cards
// ‚úÖ Validates deck name uniqueness
```

#### Secure Pricing (With Manipulation Protection)

```solidity
// Set prices with built-in protection against manipulation
cardSet.setPackPrice(0.02 ether);                        // ‚úÖ Within MIN_PRICE to MAX_PRICE bounds
cardSet.setDeckPrice("Starter Deck", 0.08 ether);       // ‚úÖ Price manipulation prevention

// Lock prices to prevent future changes
cardSet.lockPriceChanges();                              // ‚úÖ Permanent price lock
cardSet.lockDeckPrice("Premium Deck");                   // ‚úÖ Individual deck price lock
```

### Enhanced Event Listening with Security

Listen for these events to keep your backend secure and in sync:

```javascript
// Security event monitoring (CRITICAL)
cardSet.on("SecurityEvent", (eventType, actor, timestamp, event) => {
  // Log security events for monitoring
  // Trigger alerts for emergency events
  // Track unauthorized access attempts

  if (eventType === "EMERGENCY_PAUSE") {
    // Alert security team immediately
    notifySecurityTeam(actor, timestamp);
  }
});

// Payment security monitoring
cardSet.on("PaymentRefunded", (user, amount, reason, event) => {
  // Track automatic refunds
  // Monitor for payment anomalies
  updateUserBalance(user, amount, reason);
});

// Enhanced pack opening with security validation
cardSet.on("PackOpened", (user, cardIds, tokenIds, event) => {
  // Validate all security checks passed
  // Insert pack opening record with security validation
  // Update card supply counts with bounds checking
  // Update user inventory with verification
});

// Enhanced deck opening with payment security
cardSet.on("DeckOpened", (user, deckType, cardIds, tokenIds, event) => {
  // Validate secure payment processing
  // Insert deck opening record with security confirmation
  // Update user inventory with validation
});
```
